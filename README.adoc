== 😇 Behaviours

Yank into System Clipboard::
Less hastle when copy pasting between windows frequently.

Highlight Yanked Text for 150ms::
Quickly know how much text got yanked when using direct yank commands.

Scroll past EOF in buffer with `j`::
Personal preference for EOF to not be stuck at the bottom of the screen.

Show Relative Line Number on Normal Mode::
That's the only time you need Relative Line Numbers for Jumping Lines.

Show Normal Line Number on Insert Mode::
Useful when doing substitution based on line numbers.

== 📝 Autocompletion Behaviour

* Autocompletion suggestions keep popping while typing
* If the suggestion box is visible, you can do the following
* Select Next entries with: `TAB`, `C-n`
* Select Previous entries with: `S-TAB`, `C-p`
* Accept an entry with `CR` / `RET`
* Cancel Completion with `C-e`

🤔 Maybe VSCode like `DOWN` to select and `TAB` to complete might be better?

== 🛂 Custom Features

* Toggle Boolean Values with `C-a`
* Trim trailing lines and Write Buffer with `<leader>w`
* Git add . + commit -m with `<leader>gc` (Replaced with Lazygit)
* Execute files with `F5` or `:lua Execute_order_69()`
* Run file formatter with `<leader>fm` or `:lua Run_formatter()`
* Convert text to Hit Font with `:HitComment`
