== üòá Behaviours

image:./img/nvim_record.jpg[]

Important Stuff on Top Left Side::
Macro Record Status posess high importance until recording is stopped.
Therefore it stays on left side only for the time being recorded for a macro.

Less Important Stuff on Top Right Side::
Buffer list is not needed at all times, therefore it doesn't have that much
importance to interfere with the code in buffer.

Yank into System Clipboard by Default::
Less hastle when copy pasting between windows frequently.

Highlight Yanked Text for 150ms::
Quickly know how much text got yanked when using direct yank commands.

Scroll past EOF in buffer with `j`::
Personal preference for EOF to not be stuck at the bottom of the screen.

Show Relative Line Number on Normal Mode::
That's the only time you need Relative Line Numbers for Jumping Lines.

Show Normal Line Number on Insert Mode::
Useful when doing substitution based on line numbers.

== üõÇ Custom Features

image:./img/nvim_hitfont.jpg[]

* Convert text to Hit Font with `:HitFont`
* Toggle Boolean Values with `C-a`
* Trim trailing lines and Write Buffer with `<leader>w`
* Git add . + commit -m with `<leader>gc` (Replaced with Lazygit)
* Execute files with `F5` or `:lua Execute_order_69()`
* Run file formatter with `<leader>fm` or `:lua Run_formatter()`

== üìù Autocompletion Behaviour

image:./img/nvim_cmp.jpg[]

* Autocompletion suggestions keep popping while typing
* If the suggestion box is visible, you can do the following:
* Select Next entries with: `C-n`, `Down`
* Select Previous entries with: `C-p`, `Up`
* Accept an entry with `CR`, `i`, `C-i`
* Cancel Completion with `C-e`, `o`, `C-o`

If selected entry is a snippet, use `TAB` & `S-Tab` for jumping around.
